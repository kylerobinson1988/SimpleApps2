###Simple Apps, Part 2

These are simple apps we made in the latter stages of The Iron Yard's May 2015 cohort.  

####Bubbles

This app uses AV Audio to modify the bubbles in the view depending on the volume received.


####Level

This app let us try out motion sensors.  We worked with several different types of motion offered by the iPhone, and gave us an idea of how motion-sensitive the iPhone is.

####Mask

This is a simple app that showed us how to drag and resize an image added to the view.

####Money

We used this simple app to show us how to do several types of simple banner advertisements. 

####Reaction

This is a simple touch-button game that we used to practice animations.  I later modified and upgraded this app to create HENDECAGONS.

####S3Images

This app introduced us to saving images using Amazing S3/AFNetworking.  This was extremely important since I've used AFNetworking on almost every app since this one.  

####VideoTest

This is a simple video recording app I made while working on my final project.  I developed all my video functionality in here before copying it into my main final project.

####WindowsExplorer

This is a simple app that we created in order to take a look at WatchKit and other elements associated with it.
